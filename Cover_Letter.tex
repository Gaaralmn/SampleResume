\opening{Dear Recruiting Manager,} 
 
I am writing to apply for the position Software Engineer University of EMC. I know this position from the Indeed. As I have checked the information for this job. I believe that my education and experiences make me a qualified candidate for this position.

Due to the hard work on course study of the past years, I gain solid knowledge in the area of Computer Science and Engineering, like Operating Systems, Databases, Networking and Object-Oriented Programming. The project for the course Principle Database Systems let me started with Web Design, from the back-end to the front-end. I gained basic the skill of web development with LAMP after finishing this project.

I used to serve a Software Engineer Intern at AdminSys Inc, a startup that just established at earlier time this year. The past two monthsâ€™ professional experience helps me understand to some degree the whole process of developing products, from requirements to design, coding, testing, deployment and Maintenance.

As a quick learner and self-starter, I can quickly get adapted to new Environments and learn new knowledge and skills. All the experiences and properties that I have will help me to be an outstanding software engineer. 

I would greatly appreciate the chance to work for EMC and make my contribution with the related Experience and also develop myself through working with outstanding Software Engineers. I am looking forward to meet with you to discuss this position in further detail. Please feel free to contact me at your convenience by phone (929-888-3746) or email (qw422@nyu.edu).

Thanks for your time and consideration.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
